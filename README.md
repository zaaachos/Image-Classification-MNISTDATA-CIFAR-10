# Image-Classification-MNISTDATA-CIFAR-10

## Description
Academic project which refers to implementation of Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). 
The implementation consists of a MultiLayerPerceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer with M hidden units. The Neural Network was trained upon [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datasets and it tried to predict the image.
